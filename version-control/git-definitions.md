# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	- Version control is the ability to update, change, and reference previous versions of code. It's especially useful for teams who are working on a project so that they can view changes that have already been submitted or refer back to a previous version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	- A branch is an extension of the main project where a developer can make changes and edits to the program without disrupting the original line of work.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	- Commits are the submission of branch changes that you want to go live in the master branch. A good commit message is short and sweet, but detailed enough for the next user to understand the changes made.

* What is a merge conflict?
	- Merge conflict occurs when two editors make different changes to the same line of code. One person may delete the line, and someone else may just edit it. Git doesn't know which is correct, thus ensues conflict! I picture two pirates both finding "booty" at the same time and having to fight over who gets to take it home.
