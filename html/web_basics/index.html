		<h1>Turkey Day is Finally Here!</h1>
		<p>Thanksgiving is <em>finally</em> here. All that really means, is that we get to eat, <strong>tons</strong>!</p>

		<p>While the food is the ultimate goal, we've all got to make it past spending time with our families first. Follow this guide, and you'll make it through. But don't get too excited... you'll have to do it all again come Christmas!</p>

				<li>Hugs and Kisses</li>

						<li>Anyone else you actually enjoy</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Drink 
					<ul>
						<li>Booze (if you can)</li>
						<li>Sparkling Grape Juice. Because, duh.</li>

				<li>T.V.</li>
				<li>Give Thanks</li>

		<p>Applaud yourself. It's likely been a long day. Now let the turkey sink in and go to bed, just try and make it to your own house before you pass out...</p>
